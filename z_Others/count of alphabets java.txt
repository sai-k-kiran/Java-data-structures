If you want to store the frequency of each characters in a string in an array, the

1. Create an array of size 26 coz there are only 26 letters.
    int[] arr = new int[26];

2.  String s = "abbccceg"
    for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++){
            arr[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
    
The program will store the frequency of characters of the string in their order -->
Output = 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0 ...... 0

See that String s contains 
'a' = 1, 
'b' = 2, 
'c' = 3, 
'd' = 0,
'e' = 1,
'f' = 0,
'g' = 1 
and all others alphabets = 0.

And see the Output --> 
First place(0th index) is for 'a' which is only 1 in String s.
Second place(1st index) is for 'b' which are 2 in String s.
Third place(2nd index) is for 'c' which are 3 in String s.
